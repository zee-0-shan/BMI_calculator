# Create a Todo List 

# Use Javascipt to add todos and delete them on click

Instructions
* Write your code in [script.js](./script.js) file to perform the below mentioned tasks
* Add the todo in the input box
* Use the Add Todo button to add the todo inside the div with class todos
* You need to keep a count of todos created and give a key attribute to every todo that you are creating (starting from 0)
* That means your first todo would look like ```<p key="0">{Todo Name}</p>```, second would look like ```<p key="1">{Todo Name}</p>``` and so on...
* Add event listener on each todo as well, so that on clicking of that todo, it should be removed from the html document, you don't need to decrease the count of todo though

Run ```npm run test todo_list``` to test your code.
